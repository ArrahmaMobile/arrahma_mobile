> Bugs:
⦁	If there's only one audio, "next" and "previous" are still enable.
⦁	If there's three audio, you can only go to the next one, not the third one. If click on the second on, cant go back nor forward. Same thing with 3rd audio.

> Ex: Lectures > Quranic Tafseer > Ahsan-ul-Bayna > Surah Fatiha > Lesson 1 > Tafseer
